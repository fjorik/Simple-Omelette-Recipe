## Overview

### The Challenge

The goal of this project was to create a recipe page that is responsive and well-structured. The page includes an image, ingredients list, preparation time, instructions, and nutritional information, all formatted cleanly for a pleasant user experience.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I Learned

Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of responsive web design, especially how to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. I also learned how to effectively use Flexbox for aligning elements and the importance of using semantic HTML for accessibility.


### Continued Development

In the future, I want to explore JavaScript more deeply and learn how to dynamically update the recipe content, such as allowing users to adjust the servings or input their own ingredients. This will make the page more interactive and user-friendly.

### Useful Resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - An excellent game for practicing Flexbox.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always a reliable source for understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
